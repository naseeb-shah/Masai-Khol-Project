## HISTORY OF KOHLS

The first Kohl’s department store opened in Brookfield, Wisconsin in 1962. When the company went public in 1992, there were 76 Kohl’s stores in the Midwest. Kohls.com launched in 2001, giving Kohl’s an online presence that has grown and evolved over the years. In 2003, we opened 28 stores in California, giving Kohl’s a coast-to-coast presence for the first time in our history. That growth and expansion continued over the years and Kohl’s now operates more than 1,100 stores in 49 states, along with the powerful e-commerce platform of Kohls.com.
